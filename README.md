*Introduction*

Across terrestrial ecosystems, populations of habitat forming trees and grasses produce masses of seed during synchronous reproduction events (termed mast seeding). These masses of seeds are frequently stored in dormant states in soil reservoirs known as ‘seed banks’ which can remain viable from years to decades. ‘Seed banks’ ensure the rapid recovery of habitat forming species following major disturbances such as fire that can destroy entire landscapes. In coastal marine ecosystems, seagrasses can produce ‘seed banks’ which, like their terrestrial analogues, are capable of driving rapid recovery and habitat maintenance following disturbance (Rasheed et al. 2014). Yet, 'seed banks’ have not been considered for habitat-forming organisms other than plants. This is potentially an oversight as benthic invertebrates such as corals possess many life-history traits similar to mast seeding trees and grasses. 

Coral reefs undertake the largest synchronous reproduction event of any terrestrial or marine organism during the mass release of coral eggs and sperm. Similar to other habitat-forming organisms, mechanisms related to dormancy happen at multiple early life-history stages in corals. Following fertilisation and early development, coral larvae from spawning Acropora can remain competent for >6 weeks with no latent effects on larval settlement or post-settlement survival. Following larval settlement onto the reef, single polyps can remain in stasis for up to 18-months until environmental cues stimulate rapid growth. Here, we describe a previously undocumented mechanism of rapid coral recovery that we hypothesize to be driven by a dormant ‘seed bank’ of cryptic coral recruits.
